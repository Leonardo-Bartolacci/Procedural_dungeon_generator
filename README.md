# Procedural_dungeon_generator
Procedural dungeon/map generator written in pure C++.  

The program generates a dungeon blueprint that can be followed to build a playable map. It guarantees structural correctness (no overlapping rooms, no isolated areas) and focuses on deterministic, reproducible generation.
